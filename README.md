# dailyMotivation
This is a messy little HTML page I can redirect to in the LeechBlock Firefox Add-on.

It's main features are
1. display a random quote each day
2. responsive design
3. have conditional buttons only visible on certain weekdays

One can access the HTML Page [here](https://olileh.github.io/dailyMotivation/).
